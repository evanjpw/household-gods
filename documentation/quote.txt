Pray all you want, heaven can’t hear you. It’s not going to stop the winter because you are cold, and it’s not going to make the earth smaller because you don’t want to walk so far. You pray for rain and it rains, sometimes you don’t pray for rain and it rain anyway. If you wan to have a better life, educate yourself and think carefully about the consequences of you actions. — Xun Zi
