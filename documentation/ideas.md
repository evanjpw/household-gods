#Household Gods

##Concept

Household Gods help those who help themselves.

A life simulation in which you gain advantages and abilities by obtaining and mollifying or papmering houshold gods (which are statues). So you are trying to get on in the
world and do normal things like get resouces and deal with weather and succeed. And you seek help from household gods who have different wheelhouses to accomplish your
goals and succeed.

But the trick is that the househod gods actually do nothing. What you really get in the game if you obtain and worship the household gods is that it gives you more
opportunities to do things for yourself. Simulating the expanded focus you put on the thing. So if you have a crop god you have and take care of you get more opportunities
to do practical things for yourself. You think more about the crops so you get more ideas. You build more things and do more work on the crops and the game gives you more
opportunities for that.

And some of the methods of worship and rituals are actual good practical things. The crop god likes to be worshipped by putting fertilizer on the field.

##The Board (World)

 * Hex grid realized as cells that alternate only odd cells for odd rows and even cells for even rows. Acessors mean that the blank cells don't have to actually take up memory.
 * Movement in eight compas directions. For N or S skip a row.
 * '*Layers*'. A terrain layer and an object layer. And maybe an invisible sky layer and mineral (or under water) layer.
 * Things and terrain types and minerals and sky would all be enums but each would have a unicode character (for character mode display). Gods would be capital letters.
    and people and animals and things can be lower case. Maybe alternatively Gods can be some kind of runic unicode (look at possible unicode language encodings).

##Setting

 * Alien world with alien things. Try to make them cute and engaging.

##Look
 * I am thinking green purple and while rather than full color, but with nice shading if possilbe.
 * Geometric highly stylized shapes (inspired by flatland maybe)

##Programming Language Choice

Possibilities include these:

 * Ceylon (current favorite)
 * Go
 * Scala
 * Exlir (not likely, wrong project)
 * OCaml
 * Kotlin
 * Nim
